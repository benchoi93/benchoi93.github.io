I'm currently studying in Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology as a Ph.D candidate. 
My research topic is as follows:

* Urban vehicle trajectory analysis
* Application of machine learning and deep learning methods in transportation domain
* Microscopic traffic simulation and modelling human behvaior
* Mesoscopic traffic simulation with agent-based modelling approach


## Current Researches Subjects
* TrajGAIL : a generative adversarial imitation learning framework for urban vehicle trajectory generation
